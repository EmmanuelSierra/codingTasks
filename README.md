- Student_register

# Project Description:

- Small project of how to use python codes to store data in a extra text file,
- This small project example is about to show how to handle the data when a business is looking to store a big event or a daily check-in list database.
- We use a for loop that runs from 0 to the range of number of students or people signing in, and it uses to iterate that many times.
- It is a great example how to store database from inputs and propertly save them.
